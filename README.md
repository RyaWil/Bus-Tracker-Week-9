# Bus-Tracker-Week-9
Bus Tracker Animation

## Title of the Project: 
Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description of the Project
In this project there is a map of the Boston, MA area with an animation of all the bus stops from the MIT campus to the Harvard campus. 

## How to Run/Usage
Once the files are downloaded the HTML file should be loaded in a Web Browser. With a click of the button "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" there will be an animation of the bus stops from MIT to Harvard. A bubble will appear and move every two seconds.

## Roadmap of future improvements
Add a reset button to move the pin back to the beginning point.
Add a reverse path from Harvard to MIT
